# R5T.L0081.O001
Octokit-based context operations library.


## How this library works

This library contains R5T.L0066 (netstandard2.1 strictly-framework functionality) dependent functionality.
It does *not* contain R5T.L0078.F001 (netstandard2.1 strictly-framework Octokit) dependendent functionality. That is in R5T.L0081.O002.


## Allowed Dependencies

Dependencies that are *not* allowed:

* R5T.L0078.O001 - See the R5T.L0081.O002 project in this solution for the intersection of this library (R5T.L0081.O001) and R5T.L0078.O001.
